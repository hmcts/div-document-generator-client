# Document Generator

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/cd981ddf1b9648e9957a5035f18a7758)](https://app.codacy.com/app/mthava/div-document-generator-client?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=hmcts/div-document-generator-client&utm_campaign=badger)

This is a document generation and template management service. This allows to generate documents based on a
given template name and placeholder data in JSON format and will also store the generated document in the
Evidence Management Store.

The service provides a single RESTful endpoint that will generate the document, store it in Evidence Management
Store and return the link to the stored data.

### Building

The project uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org) as a build tool but you don't have to install it locally since there is a
`./gradlew` wrapper script.

To build project please execute the following command:

```bash
    ./gradlew build
```

### Running

First you need to create distribution by executing following command:

```bash
    ./gradlew installDist
```

When the distribution has been created in `build/install/div-document-generator` directory,
you can run the application by executing following command:

```bash
    docker-compose up
```

As a result the following container(s) will get created and started:
 - long living container for API application exposing port `4007`

### API documentation

API documentation is provided with Swagger:
 - `http://localhost:4007/swagger-ui.html` - UI to interact with the API resources

## Developing

### Unit tests

To run all unit tests please execute following command:

```bash
    ./gradlew test
```

### Coding style tests
