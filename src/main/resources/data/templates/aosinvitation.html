Dear {{ respsName() }},

<p>
	Your {{ respsHusbandOrWife() }} {{ respsSpouseName() }} has applied for a divorce. You can find a copy of the application included with this letter.</p>

<p>
		You need to respond within 7 days. If you donâ€™t respond, your {{ respsHusbandOrWife() }} can ask the court to move the divorce forwards without you. You may have to pay extra fees if this happens.

<h2 class="heading-small">Getting help</h2>

<p>
	The online service is written in plain English and designed to be used by citizens. If you want to use a legal representative, you must give them this letter as soon as possible.

<h2 class="heading-small">If you're a solicitor</h2>

<p>
  We're still working on the online divorce service for solicitors. For now, you'll need to respond to this divorce application using the paper forms. You can contact us to have these sent to you.
